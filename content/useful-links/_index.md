I recommend to use the projects below to integrate *supercell* program into research process. Some examples of combined approach you can find in [tutorial](/docs/tutorial).

* [**AiiDA**](https://www.aiida.net/) A scalable computational infrastructure for automated reproducible workflows and data provenance. Supercell [plugin](https://github.com/pzarabadip/aiida-supercell) is in active development by Dr. Pezhman Zarabadi-Poor.
* [**ASE**](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) Atomic Simulation Environment is another set of python tool for setting up, manipulating, running, visualizing and analyzing atomistic simulations. Support many calculation software, both classical and *ab-initio*, including CASTEP and VASP.
* [**cif2cell**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cif2cell/) Cif2cell is a tool to generate an input structure in different formats, like CASTEP, CP2K, CRYSTAL09, Quantum Espresso, VASP and many more.
* [**COD**](https://www.crystallography.net/) Open-access  structural database with more than 487 472 records (March 2022).
* [**GULP**](https://gulp.curtin.edu.au/) GULP is a force-field program for performing a variety of tasks on a range of system types. It can be useful for optimizations, energy calculation and analysis of the structure.
* [**EnCIFer**](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Community/freeservices/encifer/) A GUI tool for validating of *supercell* input structures. Useful for draft structures.
* [**OpenBabel**](https://openbabel.org/) Open Babel is a chemical toolbox designed to speak many languages of chemical data. It's an open, collaborative project allowing anyone to search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling, chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas. Over 110 formats are supported.
* [**VESTA**](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/) A powerful tool for visualization and editing of crystallographic structures. It supports many input/output format (including cif) and can visualize partially occupied sites.
