**Microsoft Windows support (experimental)** I would like to announce Microsoft Windows platform support. You can download the binary below. An output structures packing is not supported (`-a` option). The binary is tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10.

#### 24-01-2019 
**Supercell v1.1** A maximum limit for processing structures has been increased. The new version of supercell program can process up to 10<sup>15</sup> total structures. The value is far beyond a reasonable limit due to calculation time. The average program performance is about 10-100 billion structures per day with standard desktop processor. Feedback is very welcome.
